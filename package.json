  "description": "This repository contains a simple to app that I have created in phases. The first two are complete and hopefully I will be able to start on the third soon. Phase 1 was put together fast just to get an idea how to \r put this project together. It only handles client side Functionality, no server side code or database. Phase 2 is a Node.js Express app, with connectivity to a Mysql database and Bootstrap css. Phase 3 will be building \r off the last phase but with users and a login.",
